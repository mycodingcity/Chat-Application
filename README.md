## Overview 

I am excited to announce that I have built my own chat application with the help of HTML CSS Javascript and NodeJs for the backend. This project has been a fantastic learning experience, pushing me to new heights in web development.

This was a challenging project,ðŸ˜­ but I learned a lot along the way. I'm particularly proud of the way I was able to use JavaScript to create a real-time chat experience.ðŸ˜’

I am still updating this chat app and integrating new features like sending emojis pictures login features etc. Stay tuned for updates! ðŸ¤“

I'm currently looking for feedback on the chat application, so please feel free to try it out and let me know what you think. I'm also open to suggestions for new #features and improvements.
